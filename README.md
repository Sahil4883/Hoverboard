## Introduction from the Developer

# Figma Changelog
11.06.23 Updated figma model, drafted Features page with screen responsiveness.

13.6.23 Update Home page, replaced images, spread out navbar, improved subheadings. Need to draft in Form and then review surface design. Would be good to reuse app icons from features page.

15.6.23 

12:40 Complete form page, add background squiggles, recolor as Orange design. TODO: complete background squiggles on Features page, copy over app icons to Hoverboard mission feature on home page.

19:00 Orange rebranding designed. Still need a bit of image rebranding on homepage. TODO: Start coding on HTML, keep all the imgs as they are and recolor them later. Complete pages in this order: SIGN UP, FEATURES, HOMEPAGE as the latter is the most difficult.
