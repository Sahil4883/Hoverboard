I designed a responsive product introduction for a Virtual Learning Environment. The key focus for the project was responsive CSS, using flex and grid displays to allow the website to be viewed comfortably on different devices. The design utilised consistent font pairings, border-styles, padding and color themes to reinforce the visual branding of the product.

This readme aims to summarise the full documentation of this project which can be found in the links provided below the headers.

# Summary of Documentation

## User Stories

[Full documentation of User Experience Testing](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/2.-User-Experience-Testing)

For the scope of the project I limited the website's function to new users who were prospective clients of the product.

New User:
- If I am convinced enough by the product I will sign up for a free software trial.
- I need to comfortably view this website on any device such as mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop.
- I need to visualise this product's mission
- I need to understand the products features
- I need to be able to sign up for a free trial easily.


### Page Structure and scope
The focus of this website is new users of the website and three pages were designed to meet their needs.

#### Home Page:

- Landing video with slogan, *visualises the experience*
- Hoverboard's Mission, *introduces the product persuasively in the context of VLE's - why we're different*
- Testimonials from different schools, *builds authority and trust*
- Find out about our Features, *directs to page*
- Why you should claim your Free Trial, *directs to page*

#### Hoverboard Features:

- Gallery Views, *visualises easy navigation of classwork on a browser*
- Peer Feedback, *visualises student chat function in action*
- Deep Assessment, *visualises chatbot in action*
- Why you should claim your Free Trial, *directs to page*

#### Book your Free Trial:
- form input, *records essential details: name, address, school.*
- submit button, *redirects to thank you page, form method="GET"*

## Research
[see full documentation of Research here](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/Initial-Research)

In my initial research, I drew inspiration from websites like SeeSaw, ClassCharts and SatchelOne, which offer progressive features for virtual learning environments (VLEs). These platforms excel in terms of user-friendly design, intuitive interfaces, and effective visualization of learning materials. Additionally, articles on paperless schools highlighted the relevance that a fully developed version of this mock-up website might have.

## Design Testing
[Full documentation of Design Testing](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/3.-Design-Testing)
[view prototype design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/W7mEdTvxLgNZTvh1ODiuwD/HOVERBOARD?type=design&node-id=5-2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)

A figma prototype was developed to visualise responsive design. 

Home page/ Features page/  Sign up page:

## Front End Testing
[Full documentation of Front End Testing](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/4.-Front-End-Testing)

[![GitHub CSS open issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=CSS%20Issues&color=yellow)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aopen)
[![GitHub CSS closed issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/lmcrean/Hoverboard/css?label=%20&color=green)](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/issues?q=label%3Acss+is%3Aclosed)




The front-end was tested in with the following criteria:

- CSS media queries' responsivity to viewport width, key breakpoints being at mobile view, tablet view, laptop view (1208px) and desktop view (1728px). The videos demonstrate varying viewport widths between 483 to 2500px. Grid and Flex displays were used to switch between differing arrangements of content contributing to the readability.
- Design choices that are similar to those concieved in the Figma Wireframe, documented here. Effective positioning, sizing and style.
