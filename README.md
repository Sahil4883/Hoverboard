# Virtual Classroom Product mockup
As someone with an educational backgorund, I am interested in the revolutionary possibilities of Educational Technology services. I designed this page for a mock-up product, thereby allowing to prioritise essential Front-end skills.

## Strategy 

### Important Contraints
This is being completed by a single developer working within the limit of roughly 50 hours. HTML and CSS should therefore be main focus. The platform and client are fictional in order to focus on the need for front-end skills. 

Due to the time constraints, one important ommission is "demo mock-up" graphics of the platform in action, it is instead summarised with graphics. This can be revisited once developed.

### Premise: 
Hoverboard is a startup company that has developed a virtual classroom software, they are looking for users to trial their software by request-only. They want to communicate a balance of playful and trustworthiness in tone.  

### Client Objective: 
The client has heard of the startup company, they may be an educational body or a school. They may need to be persuaded that Hoverboard is a potential virtual classroom. The client already has enthusiasm for technology in classrooms.

The Client wants the site to perform some/all of these actions.
- read about the platform's features
- check the credentials
- leave details to request a trial
