I designed a responsive product introduction for a Virtual Learning Environment. The key focus for the project was responsive CSS, using flex and grid displays to allow the website to be viewed comfortably on different devices. The design utilised consistent font pairings, border-styles, padding and color themes to reinforce the visual branding of the product.

## Initial Research
[see full documentation here](https://github.com/lmcrean/Hoverboard/wiki/Initial-Research)

In my initial research, I drew inspiration from websites like SeeSaw, ClassCharts and SatchelOne, which offer progressive features for virtual learning environments (VLEs). These platforms excel in terms of user-friendly design, intuitive interfaces, and effective visualization of learning materials. Additionally, articles on paperless schools highlighted the relevance that a fully developed version of this mock-up website might have.

## Figma Design Prototype

A figma prototype was developed to visualise responsive design.
