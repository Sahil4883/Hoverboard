 I designed a responsive product introduction for a Virtual Learning Environment. The key focus for the project was responsive CSS, using ```flex``` and ```grid``` displays to allow the website to be viewed comfortably on different devices. The design utilised consistent font pairings, border-styles, padding and color themes to reinforce the visual branding of the product.

This readme aims to introduce the key features of website, generally focusing on the 5 user experience planes. It summarises key challenges addressed along the way and also provides credits.

A Testing file is dedicated to a more specific technical account of the developments.

In the issues I have logged written, video or screenshot accounts.

# UX Development Planes

- [ ] Intro

## Strategy Plane

The product was aimed at education proffessionals. These could be teachers, headteachers. The product is used by students. 

### User Stories <!-- omit in toc -->

- [ ] User pictures x2
  
New User:
- If I am convinced enough by the product I will sign up for a free software trial.
- I need to comfortably view this website on any device such as mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop.
- I need to visualise this product's mission
- I need to understand the products features
- I need to be able to sign up for a free trial easily.


## Scope plane
The focus of this website is new users of the website and three pages were designed to meet their needs.

For the scope of the project I limited the website's intended audience to new users who were prospective clients of the product.

Frameworks were not used for the scope of this project, in order to focus on learning CSS responsivity.

# Fixed bugs

The key challenge for this project was responsive design with ```style.css```. 

CSS breakthroughs included formatting images such as ```object-fit: cover``` to fit the hero-picture, using  ```display: grid```, devising a system for switching html elements over using classes with

There were fewer challenges with the HTML form, mainly getting the ```labels``` syntax correct.

Although Javascript was kept to a mininum, one bug realised the DOM wasn't loading without placing the ```<script>``` container at the bottom.

# Unfixed Bugs
For the website to function better, PHP would need to log the form data.
The navbar animation could be smoother.

# Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. You can access the live link [here](https://lmcrean.github.io/Hoverboard/).

# Future features

In the near-term future I would like to further the Front-End Design of this website with Bootstrap features and Dark mode switch.

In the long term, I would like to practise back-end features such as a PHP database.
