## Introduction from the Developer
As someone with an educational background, I am interested in the revolutionary potential of Educational Technology services. I designed this site for a mock-up EdTech product as an opportunity to develop my essential Front-end skills. The key focus for the project was responsive CSS.

## Features included

# Documentation 
## User Experience Strategy 
[ !TODO put user stories here, relate to features ]

### Client Premise:
Dr. Emily Williams is Headmaster at Meadowbrook Academy. She is expecting an Ofsted School Inspection in the next 5 years. Although her recent inspection feedback was positive, inspectors pointed out that various problems deriving from the sheer volume of paper. The top 5 include:

- it can take weeks for teachers to organise books for review by school leaders
- learning journeys quickly going out of date as the curriculum changes
- the paper copiers regularly break down every week
- important assessment documents/ paper resources occasionally are mislaid
- while there are VLE's (virtual learning environments) in place, these are limited to setting homework, merits and changing seating plans. They do not account for coursework portfolios.

One day her friend, Headmaster Benjamin Reynolds from Green Orchard School, recommends a new and promising Virtual Learning environment called Hoverboard. Benjamin has been trialling Hoverboard to reduce paper usage and organise data. THe software has a more ambitious scope than current VLEs by enabling users a chance to organise classwork on a cloud server. Later that day, Dr. Emily look's up Hoverboard on a search engine and visits their promotional website.

### Client Experience of the website and objective: 
Dr. Emily visit's the website on 2 occasions, first when she is on her phone in conversation with Benjamin, then the next day while she is on her office desktop.

Dr. Emily needs to be able to visualise the mission of Hoverboard's product. She sees the homepage which demonstrates that Hoverboard are trying to help transition schools transition to a better and richer VLE. The content is themed around education, technology and ease of use. The client needs the front-end design to be positive, engaging and professional in tone.

She wants to find out more about the features that Hoverboard offers. She visits Page 2 which demonstrates what unique features Hoverboard has to integrate student classwork, such as peer feedback, quick teacher grading and gallery views. The content is informative, persuasive and reassuring. The client needs the front-end design to use a clean layout that clearly visualises the product being used.

Finally Dr. Emily visits page 3 where she books a free trial for one year. She mention's her friend Benjamin Reynolds recommended the product which offers him a special discount. She fills in a form which captures her essential data. At the end a message appears that thanks her and assures her that their customer welcome lead will be in contact. The client needs the front-end design to be easy to read and use.

## Initial Research
### SeeSaw Platform
<img width="941" alt="image" src="https://github.com/lmcrean/VirtualClassroomMockup/assets/133490867/4d4a36f0-7c02-43b0-947a-383b1d64a6c8" caption="Copyright SeeSaw 2023">
**SeeSaw https://web.seesaw.me/

An excellent platform with progressive front and back-end features. Students are able to upload their classwork, can comment on students' work, teachers can quickly assess. The welcome page introduces the platform's features, credentials and reassures the user about privacy concerns.

The front-end is efficient, user friendly, intuitively designed. It ues simple icons to visualise the learning and show the platform on a phone, tablet and computer.

### Other VLE Websites
**ClassCharts https://www.classcharts.com/

Notable features: teachers can see their students visually on a seating plan. 

Front-end of welcome page has a nice use of overlapping phone and content, summarising features with icons, use of graphs to make relevant to assessment data.

**SatchelOne https://www.teamsatchel.com/

Homework with deadlines on a calendar. Seating plan is virtual as well.

Front-end has an appealing loading graphic, summary of app graphics works really well, use of fade in animation as page scrolls.

### Articles on Paperless Schools

> A recent study conducted showed that schools in the UK spent nearly half a billion pounds on paper each year, which is the equivalent of 3m Chromebook devices

This article discusses the benefits and steps towards becoming a paperless school. It emphasizes that going paperless can reduce waste, inefficiency, and costs, while improving school security, communication, and teaching methods. The article highlights the advantages of digital systems, such as creating a secure database, better communication with parents, increased student engagement, and the ability to automate paper-heavy processes. However, it also acknowledges potential challenges, such as digital literacy barriers and the importance of maintaining personal interactions in education.

### Front-end Design
Brainstation.io  https://brainstation.io/ 

This website's use of Landing videos and ticker effect is very visually appealing. Can be done on CSS. Also has effective use of floating navbar.

# Figma Changelog
11.06.23 Updated figma model, drafted Features page with screen responsiveness.

13.6.23 Update Home page, replaced images, spread out navbar, improved subheadings. Need to draft in Form and then review surface design. Would be good to reuse app icons from features page.

15.6.23 

12:40 Complete form page, add background squiggles, recolor as Orange design. TODO: complete background squiggles on Features page, copy over app icons to Hoverboard mission feature on home page.

19:00 Orange rebranding designed. Still need a bit of image rebranding on homepage. TODO: Start coding on HTML, keep all the imgs as they are and recolor them later. Complete pages in this order: SIGN UP, FEATURES, HOMEPAGE as the latter is the most difficult.
