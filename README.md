# Virtual Classroom mockup
## Strategy 
### Audience Objective
SaaS businesses with Educational Values that are looking for developers with essential Front-end skills, including CSS and HTML.

### Important Contraints
This is being completed by a single developer working within the limit of roughly 50 hours. HTML and CSS should therefore be main focus. The platform and client are fictional in order to focus on the need for front-end skills.

### Platform Objective: 
Hoverboard is a startup company that has developed a virtual classroom software, they are looking for users to trial their software by request-only. 

### Client Objective: 
The client has heard of the startup company, they may be an educational body or a school. They want to be persuaded that Hoverboard is a potential virtual classroom. The Client wants the site to perform some/all of these actions.
- read about the platform and it's features
- check the credentials
- leave details to request a trial
